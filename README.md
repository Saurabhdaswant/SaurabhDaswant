Hey, I’m Saurabh.

I build things on the web.
Mostly frontend. Sometimes design. Often both at the same time.

I like clean interfaces, good spacing, and small details that make things feel calm instead of loud.
I spend more time than I should tweaking UI, motion, and tiny interactions, but that’s kind of the point.

---

Stuff I use a lot:

- React, Next.js, TypeScript
- Tailwind, Framer Motion
- Figma
- Git 

---

Right now:

- Building personal products
- Getting better at interaction and motion
- Shipping more instead of overthinking

---

Outside of code:

- Working out
- Reading
- Painting once in a while
- Sitting with coffee and thinking way too much
