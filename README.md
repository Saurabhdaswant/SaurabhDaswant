# Hey, I’m Saurabh 👋

I design and build things for the web —  
interfaces that feel calm, thoughtful, and a little delightful.

Most days you’ll find me:
- polishing tiny UI details no one asked for  
- turning messy ideas into clean, usable screens  
- obsessing over spacing, motion, and “does this feel right?”

I care about **craft** more than hype  
and **shipping** more than talking.

## What I like building

✨ Products that feel simple on the surface  
🧠 Interfaces that reduce thinking for users  
🎛️ Systems that scale without becoming ugly  
🧩 Proof-of-work projects that speak for themselves  

---

## My toolbox

- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind  
- **Motion & UI:** Framer Motion, shadcn/ui, custom components  
- **Design:** Figma, interaction design, visual systems  
- **Other:** Git, async collaboration, clean workflows  

I enjoy living in the overlap of **design × engineering**.

## Currently

- Building personal products in public  
- Refining interaction and motion systems  
- Chasing that “this feels really good to use” moment

If you care about quality, craft, or building meaningful things —  
we’ll probably get along.
