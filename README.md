# Hi, I’m Saurabh 👋

I’m a Frontend / Design Engineer who enjoys building clean, high-quality products at the intersection of **design, engineering, and user experience**.

I started my journey as a self-taught developer and have spent the last few years working with startups, building real products used by real users. I care deeply about **craft**, **clarity**, and **shipping things that feel good to use**.

- Designing and building modern web interfaces  
- Turning complex workflows into simple, intuitive experiences
